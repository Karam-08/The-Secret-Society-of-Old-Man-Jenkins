        <h1>Puzzle #2</h1>
        <p>Try to solve this riddle:</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>I can fly like a bird not in the sky</p>

        <p>Which can always swim and always dry</p>

        <p>I say goodbye at night and morning hi</p>

        <p>I'm part of you, <strong>what am I?</strong></p>

        <p>I follow and lead as you pass</p>

        <p>Dress yourself in black my darkness lasts</p>

        <p>I flee the light but without the sun</p>

        <p>Your view of me would be gone</p>
