        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Seeing this text means that you know about our secret society.</p>
        <p>
            I have unleashed something terrible into the world, and I do not yet know how to stop it. 
            The details are unimportant. 
            What matters is that this website is a series of puzzlesâ€”designed to test the problem-solving skills, courage, and determination of potential members. 
            Complete all six puzzles, and you will earn your place in our secret society, joining the effort to contain what I've unleashed.
        </p>
    
        <p>When you solve a puzzle, put the answer directly into the URL.</p>
    
        <p>EX: localhost:3000/<strong>puzzle-answer</strong> (replace "puzzle-answer" with the actual answer).</p>
        
        <p>If you understand how dire the situation is (or if you're simply bored and want to pass time), type "puzzle-1" into the URL like this:</p>
    
        <p><strong><i>localhost:3000/puzzle-1</i></strong></p>
    
        <p>Think of it as practice for navigating through the puzzles.</p>
